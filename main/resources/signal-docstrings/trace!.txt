"Trace" signal creator, emphasizing (optional id) + form to run.
ALWAYS (unconditionally) returns run value, or rethrows run error.

Default  kind: `:trace`
Default level: `:info` (intentionally NOT `:trace`!)

When filtering conditions are met [4], creates a Telemere signal [3] and
dispatches it to registered handlers for processing (e.g. writing to
console/file/queue/db, etc.).

Enables tracing of given `run` form:

  - Resulting signal  will include {:keys [run-form run-val run-nsecs]}.
  - Nested    signals will include this signal's id and uid under `:parent`.

Limitations:

  1. Traced `run` form is usually expected to be synchronous and eager.
     So no lazy seqs, async calls, or inversion of flow control (IoC) macros like
     core.async `go` blocks, etc.

  2. Tracing call (`trace!`) is usually expected to occur *within* normally flowing code.
     IoC macros can arbitrarily (and often opaquely) alter program flow and tracing
     across flow boundaries can be fragile or even fundamentally illogical.

     So use within IoC macro bodies might not make conceptual sense, or could produce
     errors or unreliable/confusing results.

     Basically- if possible, prefer tracing normal Clojure fns running within normal
     Clojure fns unless you deeply understand what your IoC macros are up to.

Examples:

  (trace! (+ 1 2))         ; %> {:kind :trace, :level :info, :run-form '(+ 1 2),
                           ;     :run-val 3, :run-nsecs <int>, :parent {:keys [id uid]} ...
                           ;     :msg "(+ 1 2) => 3" ...}
  (trace! ::my-id (+ 1 2)) ; %> {... :id ::my-id ...}
  (trace!
    {:let  [x "x"] ; Available to `:data` and `:msg`
     :data {:x x}
     :msg  ["My message:" x]}

    (+ 1 2)) ; %> {... :data {x "x"}, :msg_ "My msg: x" ...}

Tips:

  - Test using `with-signal`: (with-signal (trace! ...)).
  - Supports the same options [2] as other signals [1].

  - Like `spy!`, but takes optional id rather than optional level.

  - Useful for debugging/monitoring forms, and tracing (nested) execution flow.
  - Execution of `run` form may create additional (nested) signals.
    Each signal's `:parent` key will indicate its immediate parent.

  - It's often useful to wrap `run` form with `catch->error!`:
      (trace! ::trace-id (catch->error! ::error-id ...)).

    This way you have independent filtering for `run` forms that throw,
    allowing you to use a higher min level and/or reduced sampling, etc.

    In this case you'll create:
      0 or 1 `:trace` signals (depending on filtering), AND
      0 or 1 `:error` signals (depending on filtering).

    Note that the `:error` signal will contain tracing info (e.g. `:parent` key)
    iff the enclosing `trace!` is allowed.

  - Default level is `:info`, not `:trace`! The name "trace" in "trace signal"
    refers to the general action of tracing program flow rather than to the
    common logging level of the same name.

  - Runtime of async or lazy code in `run` form will intentionally NOT be
    included in resulting signal's `:run-nsecs` value. If you want to measure
    such runtimes, make sure that your form wraps where the relevant costs are
    actually realized. Compare:
      (trace!  (delay (my-slow-code))) ; Doesn't measure slow code
      (trace! @(delay (my-slow-code))) ; Does    measure slow code

    Clj/s library that offers more advanced performance measurment and shares
    the same signal engine (filtering and handler API) as Telemere.
